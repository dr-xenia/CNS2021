# CNS 2021 Workshop
CNS 2021 Workshop "Clinical computational neuroscience: How computational neuroscience can solve problems from the clinic"

## Organizers: Xenia Kobeleva and Laure Buhry

## Date: July 7th  â€” 9:30 am to 5:45 pm (Paris Time)

## Abstract and Programme:

Despite great advances in understanding of brain function using computational neuroscience, complex neural activity analyses and models are rarely used for clinical purposes. This workshop aims to bridge this gap and to bring computational neuroscientists and clinicians together to discuss current challenges and solutions for bringing more computational neuroscience to patient-oriented questions. Topics will include translation from animal models to patients, exploration of virtual therapies and personalized medicine. Apart from several success stories of clinical computational neuroscience, we will also have discussion rounds to deep dive into current challenges of the computational neuroscience community and their potential solutions. The outcome of the workshop will be to:

* inform interested researchers on clinically relevant questions
* provide an overview of computational tools that can be used to answer these questions
* establish a working group on clinical computational neuroscience for all interested researchers and discuss practical steps to work on the roadblocks that were identified during the workshop
stablish a working group on clinical computational neuroscience for all interested researchers and discuss practical steps to work on the roadblocks that were identified during the workshop

The day will be organized around three challenges:
* Challenge 1: Translation from animal models to patients: bridging species and scales
* Challenge 2: Virtual therapies: exploring new options and refining existing treatments
* Challenge 3: Personalized medicine: how to make models fit the patient
